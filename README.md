### Hi there 👋
You can download all the files in this repository and put them into one folder. Then simply open the skova.html file in your browser to view the webpage. 
It's first real webpage so it is very minimalistic and it can't do much yet. The transcription function doesn't work that well and a translation function doesn't yet exist.
<p>这里留下的html是一个我自己搞的非常简单的网页。</p>
你可以下载这个资源库中的所有文件，把它们放到一个文件夹中。然后简单地在浏览器中打开skova.html文件来查看网页。这是我第一个真正的网页，所以它非常简约，还不能做很多事情。转录功能并不那么好用，翻译功能也还不存在。
