### Hi there 👋
You can download all the files in this repository and put them into one folder. Then simply open the skova.html file in your browser to view the webpage. 
It's first real webpage so it is very minimalistic and it can't do much yet. The transcription function doesn't work that well and a translation function doesn't yet exist.
