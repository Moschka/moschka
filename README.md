### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You can download all the files in this repository and put them into one folder. Then simply open the `skova.html` file in your browser to view the webpage. 
This is one of my first real webpages so it is very minimalistic and it can't do much yet. The transcription function doesn't work so well and a translation function doesn't exist yet.

When using using the transcirption function it is important to seperate each word or symbol with a space and to clear out all tabs and unnecessary spaces the program adds in on its own. Otherwise the transcription function won't work. Unfortunately, <s>I haven't managed to fix that yet.</s> That part has now been mostly fixed now!

My project is very small and unimpressive, so, thanks for coming by and taking a look. Have a nice day!
